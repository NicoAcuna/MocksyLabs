                content: <p>Simply put, a digital safety management system (DSMS) is a software-based system designed to help organisations manage safety more efficiently, and allows businesses to manage their safety processes and procedures electronically.
                            <br />
                           <br />
                            It provides a central location where businesses can store and manage all their safety-related documentation and data, including policies, procedures, incident reports, and training records. Some DSMS’ also automate safety-related tasks and make it easier for safety managers to manage safety records, analyse data, identify hazards, and train employees.
                           <br />
                           <br />
                            A DSMS also provides businesses with a comprehensive view of their safety performance, allowing them to identify areas for improvement and take action to address them. It also enables businesses to ensure that all their employees are aware of their safety responsibilities and that they have the necessary skills and training to carry them out.</p>

                content: <p>Chain of Responsibility refers to the legal obligations of all parties involved in the transport supply chain to ensure the safety of goods and workers. It is a concept that has been introduced into the Heavy Vehicle National Law (HVNL) to improve safety standards in the transport industry.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Under CoR, everyone in the supply chain, including employers, operators, consignors, consignees, drivers, and loaders, is responsible for ensuring that their actions or inactions do not cause or contribute to any safety breaches.

                            <br />
                            The CoR laws impose a shared responsibility for safety among all parties in the transport supply chain, regardless of whether they have direct control or influence over the transport operation. The laws recognize that everyone involved in the supply chain has a role to play in ensuring the safe transport of goods and the protection of workers.

This includes businesses that use their vehicles to transport goods or businesses that hire contractors to transport goods on their behalf.

                            <br />
                            The CoR laws require you to take all reasonable steps to ensure the safety of your employees and anyone else who may be affected by your transport operations. This means that you need to have appropriate systems and processes in place to manage the risks associated with transport activities.
